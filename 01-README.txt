Lab Assessment 1, LA-1 (15%)
----------------------------
This assessment is to evaluate performance for CLO2, to gauge
the ability to program a (simulated) robot.

CLO2: Construct robotics & automation programming for
      practical uses. (P4, PLO2, LOD C3A)
      
===============================================================
TASK: construct a simulation that have THREE (3) robots running
simultaneously, one robot displays a LEADER with random-turn
behavior and another two robots have FOLLOWER behavior using
LiDAR scans, i.e. following the nearest detected object in-front.

The leader robot have a restricted random-turn, i.e. only can
turn within the front range of the robot, from 45 degrees to the
left and right directions (0 is the front of the robot).

The follower robots should only consider the front-side of the
LiDAR scan data to decide where to navigate.

Ensure that you have well-commented codes & brief
explanations are given in important parts of the program. (P4)
===============================================================

>>> The task should take you around 45 to maximum 60 minutes
>>> to complete, in a single session. However, you are given
>>> the time period as stated in ULearn.

MARKS: 15 Marks
a. Source files (.py, .sim): 3 marks
b. First robot (LEADER): 2 marks
c. Second & third robots (FOLLOWERS): 5 marks
d. Use of LiDAR sensors: 5 marks

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Change the files accordingly, settings & program scripts.
2. Write your personal details and SHORT EXPLANATION in the
   02-PersonalDetails-Explanation.txt file.
3. This is an individual task, NO form of discussions (physical
   or online/phone/messaging) are allowed.
4. Please ZIP all the required files in a folder; name the folder
   & ZIP file as the example given, i.e. include your Section,
   Group, and matric number in the folder name & ZIP filename.
