Write below a short explanation (how it works, challenges, limitations, etc.) on your simulation answer:
Since a leader would usually run a bit faster than followers, the linear speed of the leader is set to 700mm/s 
while the followers have a linear speed of 200mm/s. Both leader and followers have the same maximum range 
(distance) that they can sense/see, 15000 mm is 15 meters. The scan index of the followers is set to 90, 270 
so that it can only consider the front-side of the LiDAR scan data to decide where to the leader goes and 
follow at the back of thier leader.
On the other hand, the scan index of the leader is set to 0, 360 so that it can consider the all-side of the LiDAR 
scan data to detect where the Can is. The challenges of this program will be to set the followers to be always slower 
than the leader and follow the leader from the back. The leader should be the one to reach the can first instead of the
follower. The limitations of this program will be the if the Can is placed closer to the follower than the leader,
the follower will reach the Can faster than the leader.
